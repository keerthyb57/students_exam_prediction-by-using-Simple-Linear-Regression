Project Overview:

This project analyzes the relationship between students’ study hours and their exam scores.
The goal is to understand how study time impacts performance and predict future scores using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

->Pandas – for data analysis and manipulation

->train_test_split – to split the dataset into training and testing sets

->LinearRegression – to build the prediction model

->r2_score – to evaluate model accuracy

->Pickle – to save and load the trained model

What I Did:

Collected and prepared the dataset of students’ study hours and scores.
Cleaned and analyzed the data using Pandas.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Built and trained a Linear Regression model.
Evaluated performance using R² score.
Saved the trained model using Pickle for future predictions.
